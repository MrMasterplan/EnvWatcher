The idea is to do the sting management in python. This presents some
problems: All variables need to be set from within the current shell. We
therefore need to do something like this:

function env-watcher {
    eval $(EnvWatcher/envwatcher.py $@ <<EOF
ENV_WATCHER: ENVIRONEMT
$(env)
ENV_WATCHER: LOCALS
$(set)
ENV_WATCHER: ALIAS
$(alias)
EOF
    )
}

the main work is obviously done in envwatcher.py. The standard output of
envwathcer.py contains the necessary shell statements the change the
environment to the desired state.
