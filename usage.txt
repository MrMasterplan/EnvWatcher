    env-watcher
    ===========

The intention of this tool is to allow you to determine the
differences in your environment between two points in time,
and to undo those differences at a later time.

usage is as follows:

env-watcher record MyName
    Take the 'before' snapshot of the environemt.
    Call the snapshot "MyName".
    
env-watcher stop MyName
    Take the 'after' snapshot of the environemt.
    Compare it to the previous snapshot called "MyName",
    compute the differences between the two in an intelligent 
    way and save this difference under the name "MyName".
    
env-watcher revert MyName
    Read the difference file "MyName", (if it hasn't been 
    stopped yet, do that now.) and revmove the changes that
    it contains from the environment

env-watcher reapply MyName

env-watcher display MyName
