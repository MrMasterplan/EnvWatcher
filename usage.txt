    ===========

  The purpose of this tool is to allow you to determine the
  differences in your environment between two points in time,
  and to undo and reapply those differences at a later time.

  Usage is as follows:

 $ env-watcher usage
    Print this usage information.

 $ env-watcher start MyName
    Start a recording session called "MyName".

 $ env-watcher stop MyName
    Stop the recording session called "MyName".
    The difference between the start and the stop point will
    be saved to a state called "MyName" and are now available
    for undoing and redoing.

 $ env-watcher undo MyName
    Revert all changes made to the environment in the recording
    session called "MyName".
    Can be called on an open session to revert to the inital state.

 $ env-watcher redo MyName
    Reapply the changes made to the environment in the recording
    session called "MyName"
    Can be called on an open session (although this doesn't make much sense).

 $ env-watcher display MyName
    Display a list of changes made to the environment in the 
    recording session called "MyName"
    Can be called on an open session to view the changes made
    since the beginning of the session.
